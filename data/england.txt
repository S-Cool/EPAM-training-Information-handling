	Advertisements want to persuade us to buy particular products How do they do it? Let us
imagine. You are watching TV. It is a hot evening: You feel thirsty. You see an advert for a refreshing
drink. You see people looking cool and relaxed. You notice the name of the refreshing drink because
you think it could be useful for you to satisfy your thirst.
	If advertisements are to he learned, there is a need for lots of repetition. But advertisers have to
be careful because too much repetition can result in consumer tiredness and the message may fall on deal ears.
	Consumers learn to generalize from what they have learned. So advertisers sometimes copy a highly
successful idea that has been well learned by consumers.For example, the highly successful Weston Tea Country
advertising for different tea has led to DAEWOO Country for automobile dealers and Cadbury Country for chocolate bars.
